# Comparator

The Comparator serves as an adapter for the [Confidential Storage Hub](../confidential-storage-hub).

It abstracts the lower-level details required to operate the CHS as well as the
[HTTP signature](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-cavage-http-signatures-10)
and [ZCAP-LD](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/zcap-ld/) authentication and authorizations schemes
used to protect resources in the CHS.

## How it works

See the [OpenAPI spec](./docs/openapi.yaml).
